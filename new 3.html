<p></p>
<p><u>Welcome Remarks</u></p>
<p>Welcome to the Reporting Platform ("the Platform") for Mandatory Reporting Regime ("MRR") for Child Abuse which is built to facilitate Mandated Reporters ("MRs") in making written reporting on serious harm child abuse cases for meeting statutory requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Notes and Disclaimers</u></p>
<ol>
    <li>The Platform is made available for the exclusive use of MRs.  If you are not a MR who is working on child abuse cases involving serious harm, please leave the Platform immediately.</li>
    <li>MR may make reference by using the section of “Decision Making and Supplementary Analytical Framework” to walk through a series of questions to understand if a case situation or scenario has met the reporting threshold.  Follow-up action suggested in the section of “Decision Making and Supplementary Analytical Framework” is for MR's reference only.  MRs should make reference to the relevant laws, procedural guidelines and or any applicable code of practice in making a decision of reporting.</li>
    <li>MR <strong>must</strong> make a <strong>verbal reporting</strong> of child abuse involving serious harm to the Authority, i.e. Hong Kong Police Force ("HKPF") or Family and Child Protective Services Units ("FCPSUs") of Social Welfare Department ("SWD"), before making a written reporting under the section of “Making Written Reporting” in the Platform.</li>

<p><u>Background</u></p>
<p>The Chief Executive announced in his 2022 Policy Address that the Government would take forward the setting up of mandatory reporting regime for child abuse cases to enhance the protection for children.  At the meeting of the Executive Council on 23 May 2023, the Council ADVISED and the Chief Executive ORDERED that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/bills.html?bill_key=10001&amp;session=2024">Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill (“Bill”)</a> should be introduced into the Legislative Council (“LegCo”).  The Bill was gazatted on 2 June 2023 and introduced to LegCo on 14 June 2023.  In the legislative proposal, professionals who have frequent contacts with the children during the course of work should be required to make mandatory report of child abuse.  A list of the practitioners is to be designated as Mandated Reporters (“MRs”) come from social welfare sector, education sector and healthcare sector.  It is proposed that mandated reporters should be required to make a report if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that a child "is suffering serious harm" or "is at real risk of suffering serious harm" during their course of work and pertaining to their scope of professional practice.</p>
<p>The Bills Committee on the Bill held its first meeting on 25 July 2023 and completed its scrutiny work at it ninth (9th) meeting on 1 June 2024.  After reporting to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2024/english/hc/agenda/hc20240621.htm">House Committee</a> of LegCo on <strong>21 June 2024 (Fri)</strong>, the Bill was put up for Second Reading (debate to resume) and consideration by committee of the whole Council and Third Reading on 10 July 2024 (Wed) and was passed at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/council-meetings.html#schedule&amp;cm20240710">LegCo meeting</a>  on <strong>11 July 2024 (Thu)</strong>.  The <strong>Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (“MRCAO”)</strong> (“Ordinance”) was gazetted on 19 July 2024 (Fri) and will take effect after 18 months, i.e. 20 January 2026 (Tue).  According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/index/chapternumber?TYPE=1&amp;TYPE=2&amp;TYPE=3&amp;LANGUAGE=E">Hong Kong e-Legislation Chapter Number Index</a>, the Ordinance has been assigned as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap650">Chapter 650</a>.</p>
<p>The MRCAO, Cap. 650, requires Specified Professionals who have frequent contacts with children to report suspected child maltreatment cases to the Authority, i.e. Hong Kong Police Force ("HKPF") or Family and Child Protective Services Units ("FCPSUs") of Social Welfare Department ("SWD"), as soon as practicable.  Failure may be an offence and result in criminal proceedings and penalty.</p>

<p><u>Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQs")</u></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the purpose of the e-Reporting Platform (“Platform”)?
The Platform is set up for the mandated reporters (“MRs”), i.e. the 25 categories of specified professionals set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (“MRCAO”), Cap. 650, to make reports on cases involving children who are suffering serious harm or are at real risk of suffering serious harm as specified in Schedule 2 of the MRCAO, for meeting the statutory requirement.</li>

<li>Who are the users of the Platform?
Specified Professionals set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the MRCAO, Cap. 650, as well as concerned staff of the Authority in handling the reported serious child-abuse cases and supporting the operation of the Mandatory Reporting Regime (“MRR”) and the Platform.</li>

<li>When to make a report of child maltreatment case?
When an incident involving child maltreatment comes to the knowledge of anyone, he/she should report the case to the Hong Kong Police Force (“HKPF”) or Social Welfare Department (“SWD”) for child protection and criminal investigation purposes.  For the MRs, if a reasonable ground to suspect that a child is suffering serious harm or at real risk of suffering serious harm comes to the notice of an MR during the course of his/her work, the MR must, as soon as practicable, make a report in respect of the child as required by law.</li>

<li>What is the specified way of making a report of a serious child-abuse case by the MRs to the Authority?
The MR shall firstly make verbal report by phone to 999 Emergency Call Centre of the HKPF or in person at a police station, or by phone or in person to the Family and Child Protective Services Unit (“FCPSU”) of the SWD.  The HKPF or FCPSU would collect necessary information for immediate actions if so required.  If the case falls within the ambit of the MACRO, the HKPF or FCPSU will provide an MRR Code to the MR for completing a report in writing in the Platform as soon as practicable within 3 working days.</li>

<li>What information is required during the verbal or in-person reporting?
The MR must provide his/her personal particulars, including the full name in English, his/her profession, contact means, etc. and a mobile phone number which can receive messages through Short Message Service (“SMS”).  He/she must also provide relevant information concerning the child suspected to have been suffering serious harm or at real risk of suffering serious harm, the circumstances and grounds leading to the suspicion, as well as any information necessary for further investigation and follow-up actions by the HKPF and FCPSU.</li>

<li>If the information collected is not suffice for the Authority to identify the child concern during a verbal report, can I still submit a written report and provide the supplementary information in the Platform?
As stipulated in section 6 of Part 2 of the MRCAO, “A report must contain sufficient information for an Authority to identify the child concerned” and the report must be made in the way specified by the Director of Social Welfare (DSW).  The MR shall firstly make verbal report by phone to 999 Emergency Call Centre of the HKPF or in person at a police station, or by phone or in person to the FCPSU.  That means, the MRs shall finish the verbal report first, before making the written report in the Platform.</li>

<li>How to login to the Platform?
The MR shall use the mobile phone number he/she provided during verbal or in-person reporting, his/her English surname combined with the initials of his/her English other names and the MRR Code received after verbal or in-person reporting for logging into the Platform.</li>

<li>What information is required for completing a reporting in the Platform?
After logging in, the Platform will retrieve a record which the MR has earlier reported verbally or in-person to the HKPF or FCPSU.  For information security reason, only the partially masked names the MR and the concerned child will be shown.  The MR has to complete all other information in the reporting form.</li>

<li>Why is it necessary for the MR to input similar information which may have been provided during verbal or in-person reporting?
It is required by the MACRO that an MR must make a report, including a written report, to the Authority in the way specified by the Director of Social Welfare (“DSW”).  MRs are required to complete the report in writing in the Platform for meeting the statutory requirement.  Written reports other than those submitted in the Platform, e.g. by email, fax or other written form, will not be accepted.  The Platform is designed as a safe and secure channel for submitting information through simple data entry by the MR.  An Acknowledgement of Receipt of the written report with the date of submitting the report will be generated automatically for the MR to keep as a record.</li>

<li>After making a report to either the HKPF or FCPSU, does an MR need to make a report on the same case to the other party?
After making a report to either the HKPF or FCPSU, MR does not need to make a report on the same case to the other party.  Upon receiving the report by either the HKPF or FCPSU, they will conduct initial screening, jointly or separately, and take actions to protect the concerned child as appropriate.</li>

<li>11.	Following the above question, can I make a MRR report to both FCPSU and HKPF?
As FCPSU and HKPF will closely collaborate on any reported cases received by either party, there is no need to make a mandatory reporting to both parties at the same time.</li>

<li>If an MR cannot complete the written reporting in a single session, can he/she save the reporting case for completion at a later stage?
MR can save a reporting case for completion later.  However, the reporting case must be completed within 3 working days after making a verbal or in-person report and receiving an MRR Code.  In case the MR has difficulty in accessing an incomplete reporting case for completion in the Platform, he/she may contact the follow-up officers of the HKPF or FCPSU for assistance.</li>

<li>Following the above question, if I do not "complete" all the specified procedures in accordance with all other "methods specified by the Director" after making a verbal report, does it mean that I have not yet completed the MRR report? Will the Authority initiate prosecution against me in this case?
In this situation, the MR may be considered as not having made a report in the way specified by the Director under section 6(3) and whether any prosecution will be initiated would be subject to DoJ’s consideration having regard to the evidence and case circumstances.</li>

<li>Can an MR edit or update the information after completing the reporting in the Platform?
After an MR has completed a reporting in the Platform, an Acknowledgement of Receipt will be sent to the MR and the reporting case is considered completed and closed in the Platform and the information cannot be edited and updated in the Platform.</li>

<li>After a mandated reporter making a MRR report, can he/she use a reported form designed by his/her own organization and submit that completed form to the Authority by mail or other means to enter the report on his/her behalf?
MRs are advisable to use the Reporting Platform for submitting a written reporting after verbal reporting.  In case an MR provides a written report other than through the Reporting Platform, the written report received by the Authority would be kept on file without inputting in the Platform.  An Acknowledgement Receipt may be issued to the MR.  However, it would be subject to DoJ’s consideration of whether the MR has made a report in the way specified by the Director and any prosecution will be initiated if so justified.</li>

<li>Is the information submitted in the Platform secured?
After completion of a written report in the Platform, information submitted in the Platform will be transferred to the information systems of the HKPF and SWD for further case management.  Information for completed reporting cases will be purged on a regular basis.</li>

<li>Can an MR request to correct the information if it was found that there is inaccurate information provided in the Platform or discrepancy of information between those reported verbally and in the Platform.
To protect the children who may be suffering serious harm or at real risk of suffering serious harm, the MR shall provide as accurate information as possible during verbal or in-person reporting as well as when submitting the written report in the Platform.  After reporting a case, the MR may approach the case officer of the HKPF and/or FCPSU to provide updated information concerning the reported case.</li>

<li>Can MRs use the Platform to make a report directly?
Given that the suspected child maltreatment cases may be involving children suffering serious harm and that potential delays may arise from requiring the MRs to complete a report in writing or by filling in a specified form, MRs should make reports by phones or in person by providing sufficient information for the Authority to identify the child concerned and follow up with the cases, before completing a report in the Platform.  A report made by phone or in person to the Police and/or the SWD, to be followed by a written report submitted in the Platform will be considered to have made the report in the way specified by the Director, i.e. Director of Social Welfare (DSW), in accordance with section 6(3) of the MRCAO.</li>

<li>19.	Can a specified professional use the Platform to check or confirm if a suspected child maltreatment case has been reported?
The Platform can only be used for making an MRR-related reporting by the specified professionals.  For information security reason, the Platform cannot be used for case checking.</li>

<li>20.	Can an MR request to make a report in the Platform even though the case circumstances may not be up to the mandatory reporting threshold?
During the verbal or in-person reporting, officers of the HKPF and FCPSU may assist the MR to make reference to the MACRO and consider whether the case circumstances would suggest that it has reached the threshold of mandatory reporting.  While the HKPF and FCPSU would accord weight for every reported case and conduct investigation and assessment and arrange child protection if the case merits, it is up to the MR to consider if he/she would like to submit a written report in the Platform.  Officers of the HKPF and FCPSU would facilitate the MR by creating a reporting case in the Platform and providing an MRR Code to the MR for completion of written report.</li>

<li>After the MR has submitted a written report directly to the Platform without making a verbal report, what will happen next?  Which side of the Authority, FCPSU or the HKPF will contact the MR?
Given that the suspected child maltreatment cases may be involving children suffering serious harm and that potential delays may arise from requiring the MRs to complete a report in writing or by filling in a specified form, MRs should make reports by phones or in person by providing sufficient information for the Authority to identify the child concerned and follow up with the cases, before completing a report in the Platform.  When FCPSU and the police receive written report directly submitted to the Platform, FCPSU and the HKPF will respectively contact the MR as soon as possible.  If situation required, they will take joint action to follow up on the case.</li>

<li>How to make a group report? If a child is found, say, in a hospital, suffering from serious harm that a mandatory reporting is required, the child will receive different treatment by different MRs.  In such case, who should make a group report? Is it necessary to wait for all MRs involved in the treatment process to come into contact with the child before making a group report?
MACRO requires that all specified professionals must make a mandatory reporting on serious harm child maltreatment cases.  It would be subject to the mutual consensus of parties involved for cases involving specified professionals from multiple disciplines such as in a hospital setting to decide on the key reporter for group reporting.</li>

<li>If a medical officer refers a child abuse case to an MSW and requires the MSW to make a MRR report as a group for the medical officer and the team at ward, MSW will become the "designated group reporting representative" or "subject officer" in disguise, all cases sent to the hospital for treatment in the future must be reported by the MSW? Can he/she refuse to make a group report on behalf of other group members and only make an individual report after seeing the child?
A MR should make a mandatory reporting if a reasonable ground to suspect a child is suffering serious harm or is at real risk of suffering serious harm come to his/her notice during the course of his/her work.  In case an MSW receives a CMO’s referral stating that a child may be suffering serious harm or at real risk of suffering serious harm, the MSW may consider making a first-hand assessment before making a reporting.  Alternatively, the MSW may also advise the CMO who is also an MR to make the mandatory reporting basing on the CMO’s case assessment, e.g. medical conditions, etc.</li>

<li>In one of the situations where there is no need to report "the person has, before the material time, committed (i) the same (or substantially the same) serious injury suffered by the child, or (ii) the same (or substantially the same) serious injury suffered by the child." Same) "Report the actual risk", can the meaning of "Report...before the critical time" be understood as: a colleague discovered the risk of serious child abuse during work and made a report, and later the risk developed into an actual child abuse incident, and the colleague Don’t you need to report it again?
Section 4(2)(c) states that “a specified professional is not required to make a report if the professional had made a report before the material time in respect of the same, or substantially the same, serious harm suffered by the child; or the same, or substantially the same, real risk of the child suffering serious harm, …”  As long as the specified professional has made a report on the circumstances leading to the real risk of the child suffering serious harm, it is not necessary to make a new report even the real risk has become serious harm.</li>

<li>I discover a child abuse incident and I judge from the collected information that its seriousness does not reach the level of mandatory reporting and I refer the incident to FCPSU through the existing mechanism to activate the child protection procedures.  However, FCPSU and / or other professional members such as medical officers make a mandatory reporting after finding out that the severity of the child's injuries during treatment. If I only made a general child abuse referral without making a mandatory report without knowing that the child was seriously injured in the first place, am I regarded breaching the MRR ordinance and will I be prosecuted?
Section 5(1) provides that “if a specified professional is prosecuted for an offence under section 4(4), it is a defence for the professional to establish that, at the time of the alleged offence, the professional had reasonable excuse for contravening section 4(1).”, i.e. at the material time, the child is judged by the MR as not suffering serious harm nor at real risk of suffering serious harm.</li>
